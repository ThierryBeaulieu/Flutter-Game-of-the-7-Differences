### 🕵️‍♂️ Seven Differences – Multiplayer Game

Seven Differences is a multiplayer mobile game developed with Flutter as part of a 14-week academic project completed by a team of 6 students. The goal of the game is to find the seven differences between two similar images as quickly as possible, either solo or against other players in real time.

The application is built with a client–server architecture. The mobile client communicates with a Node.js backend using a combination of REST APIs and WebSockets to ensure both reliable data persistence and real-time interactions.
